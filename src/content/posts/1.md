I stepped out the door this evening just to stretch my legs—no destination, no timeline. What started as a casual walk turned into a little adventure:

- I found a hidden bench tucked between two oak trees, where I sat and watched a group of kids chase fireflies.
- A local bakery was still open, so I picked up a warm croissant (crunchy on the outside, flaky on the inside—perfect).
- I noticed a wall covered in hand-painted murals I’d never seen before, even though I’ve lived here for years.

It’s easy to rush through days with a to-do list, but these unplanned moments are where the small, happy surprises live. By the time I got home, my mood was lighter, and I had a handful of little memories to smile about.
